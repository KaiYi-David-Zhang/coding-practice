- follow a course called "SQL for Data Analysis: Weekender Crash Course for Beginners" on udemy
- course url:https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-for-newbs/

- NOTES:
- SELECT: tells the database what information to give back
- FROM: what table are we using
- WHERE: put coniditions on the information getting back (kinda like a filter?)
- COUNT: how many items meet the condition we ask for, (counting the rows what meets the conditions)
- GROUP BY: group the return rows by the inputed title
- REMEMBER ORDER MATTERS!!!!!!!!!
- when using key word "as" the assigned name becomes the column name after search
- ORDER BY: orders the rows based on the select column, use keyword "desc" to make the list descending
- SUM: useful when tracking total
- LEFT (field, int): give some leftmost segment of the field, the integer represents how many spaces from the left do we want
- MIN: 
- MAX:
